## Diceware 
Dicewareâ„¢ is a method for picking passphrases that uses dice to select words at random from a special list called the *Diceware Word List*. Each word in the list is preceded by a five digit number. All the digits are between one and six, allowing you to use the outcomes of five dice rolls to select a word from the list.
